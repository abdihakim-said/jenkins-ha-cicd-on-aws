# 🚀 Jenkins High Availability CI Infrastructure Solution

## 📘 Overview

This project delivers a **secure, scalable, and highly available Jenkins CI/CD platform** on AWS, designed with full automation and production-grade architecture.

> ✅ I was solely responsible for designing, building, automating, and securing the entire infrastructure from the ground up — aligning technical excellence with business goals.

## 🧩 Business Scenario

A mid-sized tech consulting firm was struggling with:

- Jenkins master instability and **frequent downtime during upgrades**
- Manual, **time-consuming infrastructure management**
- **Manual deployments** Inconsistent configurations across environments
- **Scalability issues** as team sizes and workloads grew
- Increased **operational overhead** for DevOps teams
- Lack of **security best practices and compliance posture**

---

## ❗ Objectives

The challenge was to implement a Jenkins infrastructure that is:

- ✅ **Highly available** across AZs
- ✅ **Zero-downtime upgrade capable**
- ✅ **Automated** from image to deployment using Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ **Security-compliant** and auditable
- ✅ **Scalable** Scales automatically based on workload with auto-healing and dynamic agent provisioning

## 🤔 Why Jenkins (HA) over GitHub Actions or GitLab CI?

While GitHub Actions and GitLab CI are great tools, I chose **self-hosted Jenkins in an HA setup** because:

- ✅ Full **infrastructure control** for compliance-heavy environments and **customizability**
- ✅ - Greater **plugin ecosystem** and compatibility with legacy integrations
- ✅ - Native support for **Blue-Green upgrade strategies** to achieve zero-downtime
- ✅ - High availability with **Elastic Load Balancer** and **Auto Scaling**
- ✅ - **Centralized, scalable CI** across multiple teams

  This setup gave the client a **centralized, secure, and team-friendly CI platform** that could scale with demand and evolve with minimal vendor lock-in.

## 🧠 Why EC2 Over EKS?

As the lead DevOps consultant, I recommended EC2 over EKS for several key reasons:

### ✅ Business Constraints & Budget
- EKS introduces **control plane and per-service costs**, plus additional complexity.
- EC2 with Auto Scaling and EFS offered **predictable, lower cost**, and simplified management.

### ✅ Internal Team Skillset
- The client’s team had **no Kubernetes experience**.
- EC2 allowed them to leverage their existing knowledge in Linux, EC2, and Jenkins.

### ✅ Simplicity and Stability for Jenkins Master
- Jenkins master is a **stateful workload**.
- EC2 + EFS provided **straightforward backups, persistence, and auditability** without dealing with PVCs, StatefulSets, or persistent volume issues.

### ✅ Simpler HA and Upgrades
- **Blue-green upgrades** with ELB + Packer AMIs were easier to build and roll back compared to Kubernetes-based Jenkins master deployments.

### ✅ Fit for Purpose
- The goal wasn’t containerization, but a **stable, secure, and scalable CI/CD platform**.
- EC2 delivered more value faster and kept long-term maintenance simple for the client.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (End-to-End by Me)

#### 1️⃣ Image Creation – **Packer**
- Built secure, pre-configured Jenkins master AMIs
- Automated **plugin installation**, OS hardening, and security updates
- Integrated **vulnerability scanning** during image builds
- automated quarterly image refresh strategy

### 2️⃣ Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
- Deployed **multi-AZ architecture**
- Provisioned EC2 + EFS for persistent storage
- Provisioned Auto Scaling Groups for Jenkins agents
- Provisioned Elastic Load Balancer for traffic routing
- Provisioned Network setup (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Terraform state stored securely in S3 with DynamoDB locking
- Modular and reusable codebase

### 3️⃣ Jenkins Configuration (Ansible)
- Configured Jenkins securely: RBAC, CSRF, plugin setup, CLI lockdown
- Used **Ansible roles** for idempotent and repeatable config

### 4️⃣ Deployment Strategy: Blue-Green
- Deployed new Jenkins master instances in parallel
- Verified health checks before traffic switch using **ELB target groups**
- Ensured **zero-downtime** upgrades and instant rollback with minimal user impact

### 5️⃣ Monitoring and Observability
- Configured **Prometheus exporters** on Jenkins nodes to export Jenkins metrics
- Built **Grafana dashboards** for visibility on jobs, queues, agents
- Logs pushed to **CloudWatch** with alerting
